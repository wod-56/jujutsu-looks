    </header>

    <article class="card">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

When the series premiered, its moody visuals, cursed energy aesthetics, and sleek character outfits sparked a wave of creative fashion crossovers. In particular, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen shirts</em> became symbols of modern anime culture, merging expressive storytelling with the self-expression of streetwear.</p>

      <h2>From Screen to Streetwear</h2>
      <p>The transition from anime merchandise to legitimate fashion was gradual — until Jujutsu Kaisen arrived. Its visual identity lent itself to streetwear trends already rooted in bold typography, mysticism, and layered symbolism. Brands and fans alike noticed how the anime’s tone could blend seamlessly with contemporary aesthetics. Fashion outlets and anime media have covered this crossover extensively, recognizing how series like JJK are transforming wardrobe staples into pop culture icons.       <ul>
        <li>Minimalist seals and cursed symbols mirror high-end design cues.</li>
        <li>Muted color palettes fit effortlessly into modern streetwear.</li>
        <li>Collabs with apparel labels elevate perception from “fan shirt” to collectible fashion.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These design evolutions reflect a global fashion shift: anime as art, not just media. Jujutsu Kaisen helped legitimize that transformation.</p>

      <h2>Design Philosophy Behind Jujutsu Kaisen Shirts</h2>
      <p>JJK’s creators understand aesthetic balance. The art direction combines Japanese occult symbolism, calligraphy, and grunge-style energy bursts — perfect for clothing design. When translated onto shirts, those visuals maintain intensity while remaining wearable. Instead of relying on bright colors and obvious character prints, JJK designers favor abstraction.</p>
      <h3>Key Elements Found in Popular JJK Shirt Designs:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimal Typography:</strong> Cursed energy scripts or sorcerer names in kanji create intrigue.</li>
        <li><strong>Subtle Symbolism:</strong> Gojo’s infinity eye or Sukuna’s marks used as minimalist emblems.</li>
        <li><strong>Texture & Layering:</strong> Distressed prints and faded fabrics replicate battle-worn visuals.</li>
        <li><strong>Monochrome Appeal:</strong> Black, sand, and muted yellow dominate collections for a timeless aesthetic.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These artistic choices blur the line between fan apparel and designer wear, allowing anyone to wear JJK pieces confidently beyond conventions or anime events.</p>

      <h2>Market Growth and Global Influence</h2>
      <p>Anime merchandise is now a billion-dollar market, but the success of JJK apparel represents something deeper: an intersection of fandom, identity, and high design. After Jujutsu Kaisen’s explosive debut, online stores and retailers reported a surge in anime-inspired apparel searches. Fashion analysts link this growth to younger audiences who want clothing that represents their interests without sacrificing aesthetics.</p>
      <p>Brands like UNIQLO, Supreme Japan, and several independent designers have released capsule shirts inspired by anime motifs — and JJK often sits at the center of these trends. By reinterpreting narrative symbolism through wearable fashion, the series helped bridge streetwear culture with storytelling artistry.</p>
